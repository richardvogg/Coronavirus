# Coronavirus

A short code to review current Coronavirus cases in selected countries of interest.

In specific I am interested in how the countries with most cases are developing, and compare this to Chile where I currently live.
Secondly, it is also interesting to compare Chile to the rest of Latin America.

I load the data from the package Coronavirus from RamiKrispin ([link](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)) which pulls the data daily from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

Removed Brazil because it had so many cases that the other countries were not clearly separable.
